    <h2><strong> Div and Span</strong></h2>
    <p>The <span>HTML</span> elements div and span are different because they have no semantic value by themselves. This
      means that they are the perfect <span>HTML</span> tags to use when you have to separate content for purely visual
      purposes. <br>
      By themselves, div and span will not do anything. These elements are primarily used as "hooks" for your CSS (as
      well as JavaScript). You use them to divide or label your HTML when another, more semantic tag will not work.
      These will be targeted as selectors in our CSS.</p> <br>

    <h3><strong> DIV </strong> tag</h3>
    <p>The div tag is a block level <span>HTML</span> element. It is used to divide or section other
      <span></span>HTML</span> elements into groups. We use it when no other more semantic element is appropriate
    </p>
    <br>

    <h3><strong>Span</strong> tag</h3>
    <p>The span element is an inline <span>HTML</span> element that is used to group a set of inline elements. Generally
      speaking, you use span to hook text or a group of elements that you want to style differently. Often though, you
      can do this more semantically by using other elements like <em> em</em> or <strong> strong</strong>.</p> <br>

    <h2><strong>Class and id</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Class</strong> and <strong>id</strong> are <span> HTML</span>Attributes. They are also used as CSS and
      JavaScript hooks. class and id attributes can be added to any <span>HTML</span> element.</p> <br>

    <h3>id <strong>Attribute</strong></h3>
    <p>The id attribute is used to label sections or parts of your <span>HTML</span> document. <br>
      You may only use the same id attribute value once per html page, so save it for important major sections of your
      page.
      The id selector in CSS has a high specificity level and therefore overrules most other CSS selectors (more on this
      later).
      Think of id attributes as being very important. The current best practice in web design is to reserve id's for use
      as JavaScript hooks rather than in CSS because of the high specificity.</p><br>

    <h3>Class <strong>Attribute</strong></h3>
    <p>The class attribute is used to classify parts your document.
    <ul>
      <li>The same class attribute value can be used many times on the same page</li>
      <li>The class selector in CSS has a medium specificity level in CSS </li>
    </ul>
    </p> <br>
  </div><br>

  <div id="section-3">
    <h2><strong>Superscript, Subscript & Deleted text</strong></h2>
    <p id="special-paragraph">A subscript or superscript is a character (such as a number or letter) that is set
      slightly below or above the normal line of type, respectively.
      <br> The Deleted Text element. The "del" <span>HTML</span> element represents a range of text that has been
      deleted from a document. This can be used when rendering "track changes" or source code diff information, for
      example. <br>The below are examples of other types of text that can be emnedded in <span>HTML</span> coding
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><sup>superscript</sup> text</li>
      <li><sub>subscript</sub> text</li>
      <li><del>deleted text</del> <ins>inserted text</ins></li>
    </ul>
